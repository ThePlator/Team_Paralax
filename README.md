# To design a class routine / schedule creation system

Manually class routine creation system is tedious and overwhelming. This approach also suffers from various conflicts in teacher coordination. Sometimes same teacher is assigned to different class at same time which is difficult to track when number teacher ,subject and classes are very high.
We are expecting the participants to write and develop web application to perform this tedious task i n ease.

The project can be made as a Web Application which allows users to create the schedules easily.

1. Teachers/Professor can be added, updated and removed.
2. Classes can be created, updated and removed.
3. Subjects can be added, updated and removed.
4. Routines can be created on basis of class.

5. Landing Page should contain information about
   a) No of professors created so far.
   b) No of users created so far.
   c) No of routines created.

Note: - Application should be capable of detecting conflicts on teacher availability at period and do not allow such conflict operations.
